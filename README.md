## Design

- The Site logo was taken from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/gaelic-football-square-line-vector-icon-1998494597) and i changed it a little in photoshop. I also used this image as my favicon.

- Homepage background image was taken from [Gaa.ie](https://www.gaa.ie/news/weekend-fixtures-guide-125479/)

- Colours used were greys and mainly bootstrap-info (#5bc0de). I really like the contrast of the plain white background across most of the site with the very colourful products on show.
